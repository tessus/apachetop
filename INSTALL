|                  ApacheTop INSTALL Instructions                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

ApacheTop is now distributed with autoconf files, a nice easy way to build
distributions whatever platform you're on.

1) Building ApacheTop from a cloned repository
2) Building ApacheTop from a tarball
3) custom configure options
4) If it fails to build

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. Building ApacheTop from a cloned repository                       |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

git clone https://github.com/tessus/apachetop.git

cd apachetop
./autogen.sh                                        (autotools required)
./configure                                  (see section 3 for details)
make
make install                                      (as root or with sudo)

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. Building ApacheTop from a tarball                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Download the latest tarball from:
https://github.com/tessus/apachetop/releases/latest

tar -xzf apachetop-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

cd apachetop-X.Y.Z
./configure                                  (see section 3 for details)
make
make install                                      (as root or with sudo)

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. custom configure options                                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

There's a few custom ./configure options and overrides:

    --with-logfile=<log>                                (added in v0.11)
        You may specify the location of the default logfile
        to open. This overrides the #define in apachetop.h.
        Of course, you can just use -f on the apachetop
        commandline, but if you'll only ever use one log, you
        can give it to configure and never worry about it again.

    --with-pcre2=<path>                               (added in v0.23.2)
        Specifies where to find the pcre2 installation in the
        event it's not in your standard path. configure should look
        for <path>/include/pcre2.h and <path>/lib/libpcre2.*

    --with-fam=<path>                                   (added in v0.12)
        Specifies where to find the FAM installation. The path you
        give should contain include/fam.h and lib/libfam.*
        kqueue will be preferred to fam if both are found on the system.

    --with-pcre=<path>                                  (added in v0.12)
        Specifies where to find an adns installation.

| 4. If it fails to build                                              |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Make sure you have the -dev sources for readline and (n)curses. These
contain files required to build binaries that use these libraries; for
example on Debian you'll need the libreadline4-dev package installed.
